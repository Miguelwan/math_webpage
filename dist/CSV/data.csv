We discuss the relevant concepts and tools that go into a core model induction through L(R) (or more generally through models of the form Lp^\Sigma(R)). We provide examples (PFA, the existence of an \omega_1-dense ideal on \omega_1 etc) that illustrate how these concepts are used in practice.";"Please contact Ernest Schimmerling in advance for the zoom link."

And, if you think about monoids at all, you noted that it applies in a limited way to monoids. The notion of a Cayley monoid is just an internalization of this type of representation. There are many examples of Cayley monoids. Some of these are obtained from the group of a monoid acting on the monoid itself. There are some interesting special cases of Cayley monoids with strong <_{L} commutativity properties . An example is provided by the monoid Z*Q where Q is the quaternion group. In these cases we say that the Cayley monoid has an autonomous commutator. Here will will show that every monoid can be extended to a Cayley monoid with an autonomous commutator.";"See the seminar webpage."

Generalizing this concept, given a cardinal κ, I call an object <κ-blurrily ordinal definable if it belongs to an ordinal definable set with fewer than κ elements (called a <κ-blurry definition). By considering the hereditary versions of this notion, one arrives at a hierarchy of inner models, indexed by cardinals κ: the collection of all hereditarily <κ-blurrily ordinal definable sets, which I call <κ-HOD. In a ZFC-model, this hierarchy spans the entire spectrum from HOD to V.
The special cases κ=ω and κ=ω1 have been previously considered, but no systematic study of the general setting has been carried out, it seems. One main aspect of the analysis is the notion of a leap, that is, a cardinal at which a new object becomes hereditarily blurrily definable.
In this talk, I will focus on the ZFC-provable structural properties of the blurry HOD hierarchy, which turn out to be surprisingly plentiful. So for the most part, the talk will be forcing-free. Time permitting, I may hint at the result of the equiconsistency between the least leap being the successor of a singular strong limit cardinal and the existence of a measurable cardinal, for which, admittedly, forcing is used in one direction.";"The talk will take place in hybrid mode.
